# Week 2 – Norman Heuristic – Proposal & UX/UI

## Norman Heuristic Laws Applied

- User Control and Freedom  
- Consistency and Standards  
- Flexibility and Efficiency of Use  
- Aesthetic and Minimalist Design  

## Purpose

-This proposal evaluates the Toronto Cupcake website using Norman’s heuristic principles to identify usability, design, and interaction issues that negatively affect the overall user experience. The primary goal is to improve usability, trust, and visual appeal, particularly for customers purchasing cupcakes or corporate catering services.

## Issues with the Site

### Navigation

-The website’s navigation is confusing and poorly structured, especially for first-time users. Primary actions such as **Shop**, **Cart**, and **Ordering** are not immediately visible, creating friction early in the user journey. The vertical dropdown navigation feels outdated and inconsistent with modern e-commerce conventions. In addition, the lack of consistency across pages makes users unsure of their location within the site. Navigation also does not scale effectively across different screen sizes, reducing flexibility and efficiency of use.

**Norman Principle Impact – Navigation:**  
Navigation issues violate **Consistency and Standards**, as the layout does not follow common web conventions. **User Control and Freedom** are also affected because users struggle to move easily between pages.

### Shop / Catalogue

The shopping cart is difficult to locate and is not persistently visible, disrupting the purchasing process. The catalogue lacks a clear visual hierarchy, making it difficult for users to quickly scan products. Product images are inconsistent in size and sometimes stretched, which reduces perceived quality. Pricing information is not always clearly displayed, increasing uncertainty during purchasing decisions.

**Norman Principle Impact – Shop / Catalogue:**  
These issues impact **Visibility of System Information**, as users cannot easily view product details and pricing. **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use** are reduced because browsing and purchasing require unnecessary effort.

### Design

The overall design appears outdated and unprofessional and does not reflect a gourmet or premium cupcake brand. Inconsistent spacing, padding, and alignment create a disjointed visual experience. Typography choices reduce readability and cause visual strain. Pages are overly text-heavy and include unnecessary information, which overwhelms users. As a result, the design fails to appeal to corporate or upscale event clients.

**Norman Principle Impact – Design:**  
The site violates **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design** due to excessive clutter. **Credibility and Trust** are also negatively affected, as poor design reduces user confidence.

## Changes to Make

### Website Design

A consistent visual structure should be established using grids, spacing, and alignment. The layout should be modern, clean, and responsive across devices. Images must scale properly without appearing cropped or stretched. Visual clutter should be reduced, and a strong visual hierarchy should be created using headings, spacing, and color contrast.

### Navigation Changes

The vertical dropdown menu should be replaced with a horizontal navigation bar. Key links such as **Home**, **Shop**, **Cart**, and **Contact** should remain visible at all times on desktop. Menu labels should align with user expectations, and navigation placement should be consistent across all pages.

**Benefits for Navigation Functionality:**  
These changes improve user confidence and reduce confusion, supporting **Consistency and Standards**.

### Tasteful Animation

Subtle hover effects should be added to buttons and links. Smooth transitions can be used to guide user attention, such as when items are added to the cart. Excessive or distracting animations should be avoided.

**Norman Principle – Tasteful Animation:**  
Animations enhance feedback and user awareness without overwhelming the user.

### Header

Unnecessary information such as USA tariffs, dates, and redundant links should be removed. Repeated logo banners should be eliminated. Header imagery should be modernized to reflect a premium cupcake brand, and the layout should clearly communicate the site’s purpose.

### Footer

Footer hover states should be consistent, with improved alignment, spacing, and padding. Menus and social icons should be clearly organized to make content easier to scan.

### Branding Design

The website should be rebranded to better reflect a niche gourmet market. The design should appeal to corporate catering clients while balancing trendy elements with elegance and professionalism. Visuals should emphasize quality, freshness, and craftsmanship.

### Shop / Cart

The cart should be accessible at all times through a persistent cart icon. Clear feedback should be provided when items are added or removed. The checkout flow should be simplified to reduce friction.

**Norman Principle View – Shop / Cart:**  
Improved checkout supports **User Control and Freedom**, helping users feel confident and informed.

### Catalogue Improvements

Product images should maintain consistent aspect ratios. Padding and spacing across product cards should be uniform. Products should be organized into clearly defined sections using column-based layouts for easier scanning. Key information such as price and flavors should be highlighted.

### Content Cleanup

Pricing must be consistent and clearly displayed. Redundant pages and unnecessary information should be removed.

### Combine Overlapping Content

Repeated FAQ questions should be merged. The **Resources** and **Occasions** pages should be combined, and delivery information should be included within the FAQ section.

## Based on Norman Heuristic Standards

Based on Norman’s usability principles, the Toronto Cupcake website suffers from multiple usability, design, and functional issues that negatively impact the user experience, particularly during browsing and purchasing.

### Visibility and Information

Important information such as product descriptions, delivery options, and customization details is often missing or hidden. Product images do not consistently communicate quality or detail.

### Navigation and Functionality

Navigation structure is unclear and inconsistent. Some features appear unfinished or lack visual clarity. The ordering process is not streamlined, and limited customization options reduce flexibility for users.

### Design and Layout

Poor typography and text-heavy layouts reduce readability. Weak visual hierarchy makes it difficult to locate important information.

### Error Handling and User Control

The lack of clear error messages during checkout increases user frustration. Users are not given enough feedback when actions are taken.

### Trust and Credibility

Missing or unclear information reduces trust. An unpolished design makes the site feel unreliable.

## Based on the 7 Usability Factors to Focus on Improving

### Usability

Navigation, cart, and catalogue functionality must be intuitive and efficient so users can complete purchases with minimal effort.

### Credibility

Professional and consistent design across all pages, combined with high-quality imagery and clear product information, will strengthen credibility.

### Desirability

A trendy yet elegant design should visually reflect high-quality products and appeal to both individual customers and corporate clients.
