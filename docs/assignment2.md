# Week 2 – Norman Heuristic - Proposal & UX/UI

## Norman Heuristic Laws Applied

- User Control and Freedom
- Consistency and Standards
- Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
- Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

### Purpose

>This proposal evaluates the Toronto Cupcake website using Norman’s heuristic principles and identifies usability, design, and interaction issues that negatively affect the overall user experience. The goal is to improve usability, trust, and visual appeal particularly for customers purchasing cupcakes or corporate catering services.

## Issues with the Site

### Navigation

- Navigation is confusing and poorly structured, especially for first time users
- Primary actions such as Shop, Cart, and Ordering are not immediately visible
- Vertical dropdown navigation feels outdated and inconsistent with modern e-commerce conventions
- Lack of consistency across pages makes users unsure where they are within the site
- Navigation does not scale effectively across screen sizes, reducing flexibility and efficiency

### Norman Principle Impact in Navigation

- Consistency and Standards – Navigation does not follow common web standards
- User Control and Freedom – Users struggle to easily move between pages

### Shop/ Catalogue

- Shopping cart is difficult to locate and not persistently visible
- Catalogue lacks visual hierarchy, making it hard to scan products quickly
- Product images are inconsistent in size and sometimes stretched, reducing perceived quality
- Pricing information is not always clearly displayed

### Norman Principle Impact in Shop / Catalogue

- Visibility of System Information – Users cannot easily see product details and prices
- Flexibility and Efficiency – Browsing and purchasing require extra effort

### Design

- Overall design appears outdated and unprofessional
- Does not reflect a gourmet or premium cupcake brand
- Inconsistent padding, spacing, and alignment across pages
- Typography choices reduce readability and strain users visually
- Pages are text-heavy with unnecessary information
- The design does not appeal to corporate or upscale event clients

### Norman Principle Impact in Design

- Aesthetic and Minimalist Design – Excessive clutter distracts users
- Credibility and Trust – Poor design reduces user confidence

## Changes to Make

### Website Design

- Establish a consistent visual structure using spacing, grids, and alignment
- Apply a clean, modern layout that adapts to different screen sizes

### Navigation changes

- Replace the vertical dropdown menu with a horizontal navigation bar

## Based on Norman Heuristic Standards

- Based on Norman’s usability principles, the Toronto Cupcake website suffers from several usability, design, and functional issues that negatively impact the user experience particularly during the browsing and purchasing process.
