# Week 3 – Website User Stories and User Personas

Although I am not enrolled in **ACIT 2811**, I learned about **User Personas** and **User Stories** through my Agile course with Tomoko. Using this knowledge, I applied a user-centered design approach to analyze the Toronto Cupcake website. The following user scenarios represent realistic users with clear goals, expectations, and behaviors related to wedding planning and event catering.

These scenarios help identify usability issues, navigation gaps, and opportunities to improve efficiency, clarity, and overall user experience.

## User Scenario 1 (User Story 1)

In this scenario, the user is a **professional wedding planner** responsible for choosing cupcakes for a wedding reception. The user’s main goal is to explore different cupcake options, compare flavors and quantities, and ensure that dietary requirements are met for all guests.

The user begins on the **homepage**, expecting to immediately understand what the website offers and how to navigate it. From the main navigation menu, the user accesses the cupcake catalogue and browses through available cupcake options. Since weddings often involve guests with allergies or dietary restrictions, the user applies **filters by allergen** to narrow down safe options. The user then navigates to the allergen information page to review ingredient details and confirm that the selected cupcakes meet safety requirements.

Throughout this process, the user expects clear visuals, consistent navigation, and accurate information. A successful outcome for this scenario is the ability to confidently select cupcake options that meet both aesthetic and dietary needs without confusion or unnecessary steps. This scenario meets the assignment requirements by clearly defining the user’s role, goal, and interaction flow while reflecting a realistic and common use case.

## User Scenario 2 (User Story 2)

In the second scenario, the user’s primary goal is to **find delivery information efficiently** in order to save time while planning a wedding. This user is focused on logistics rather than product selection and wants quick access to delivery-related details.

The user starts on the **homepage** and looks for clear navigation options related to delivery or services. Using the navigation menu, the user explores relevant sections of the website, including the cupcake catalogue and informational pages, to locate delivery details. The user expects to find clearly presented information about delivery range, delivery fees, minimum order requirements, and estimated delivery timelines.

The user values efficiency and clarity and becomes frustrated if information is hidden or difficult to locate. A successful outcome for this scenario is being able to quickly confirm whether delivery services meet the event’s needs without searching through multiple pages. This scenario meets the assignment specifications by focusing on task efficiency and highlights the importance of clear information architecture.

## User Scenario 3 (User Story 3)

The third scenario builds on the previous delivery-focused scenario but emphasizes **speed, clarity, and reduced effort**. In this case, the user may be under time pressure and needs to confirm delivery details quickly before making final event decisions.

The user begins on the **homepage** and navigates directly to delivery-related content through the main menu or the cupcake catalogue. The user expects essential information such as **delivery range, fees, service conditions, and restrictions** to be clearly visible and easy to scan. The user does not want to read long paragraphs or navigate through multiple pages to find critical details.

A successful outcome for this scenario is locating all necessary delivery information within a short amount of time and feeling confident in proceeding with planning. This scenario reinforces the importance of intuitive navigation, clear labeling, and concise content presentation. It meets the assignment requirements while adding value by addressing time-sensitive user needs and usability expectations.
