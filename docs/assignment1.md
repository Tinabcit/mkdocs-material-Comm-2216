# Overview of Project

## Group Project: Toronto Cupcake – UX Website Redesign

## Website Chosen

Although I am not enrolled in ACIT 2811, I am grouped with Anna and Ava, who are taking the course. Our team selected Toronto Cupcake as the website for our UX redesign project.

Toronto Cupcake is a well-established business that specializes in gourmet cupcakes for holidays, corporate events, weddings, and large celebrations. The company has strong brand recognition and a clear product offering; however, the current website does not reflect the quality of the brand. The existing design feels outdated and cluttered, making it difficult for users to navigate the site, find products, and complete purchases efficiently. This made Toronto Cupcake an ideal candidate for a UX-focused redesign.

## Why We Chose This Topic

We chose Toronto Cupcake because it clearly demonstrates how poor UX and visual design can negatively impact user trust and engagement, even when the business itself is strong. Specific reasons included:

- The brand is recognizable, but the website lacks polish and professionalism
- Navigation is confusing and does not follow common usability conventions
- The visual hierarchy is weak, making it hard for users to identify important information
- The design does not align with the expectations of customers planning upscale events
- There is a strong opportunity to improve usability without changing the core business content

This project allows us to explore how thoughtful UX and UI improvements can significantly enhance a user’s experience and perception of a brand.

## Areas Selected for Redesign (Team Focus)

As a team, we identified several major UX and UI issues and focused on the following areas:

### Navigation Structure

- The current navigation is cluttered and difficult to scan
- Important pages such as the shop, cart, and ordering information are not immediately obvious
- Our redesign focuses on a simplified, horizontal navigation menu with clear labels

### Visual Hierarchy

- Headings, images, and calls-to-action compete for attention
- Improvements will be made through consistent typography, spacing, and layout

### Shop and Cart Experience

- Current imagery does not support the “gourmet” positioning of the brand
- Higher-quality visuals and consistent branding will create a more premium feel

### Content Organization

- Information is scattered and overwhelming
- Content will be reorganized into clear, goal-oriented sections

## My Individual Contributions

While working collaboratively with the team, my individual focus has been on visual and UX analysis. My contributions include:

- Conducting a visual design critique of the existing website
- Identifying layout issues such as inconsistent spacing, alignment problems, and cluttered sections
- Analyzing misalignment between the design and target audience expectations
- Providing UX-focused recommendations to improve clarity, usability, and flow
- Suggesting accessibility and readability improvements without altering brand identity

## What I Hope to Gain From This Class

Through this course and project, I hope to:

- Develop a stronger understanding of usability principles and UX heuristics
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world website redesign problems
- Improve my ability to analyze and critique designs from a UX perspective
- Learn to translate UX principles into practical design decisions
- Strengthen collaboration and communication skills in a team environment

Overall, this project is helping me better understand how design choices directly affect user experience, brand perception, and usability.
